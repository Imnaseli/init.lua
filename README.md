# neodots.
> my neovim configuration 

"Neodots" is the culmination of my Neovim journey, carefully crafted to suit my coding preferences and workflow. It reflects my ongoing effort to enhance productivity and create an enjoyable coding environment. Currently used on my Windows machine for university tasks, this configuration is a result of continuous refinement. I install plugins only when truly needed, acknowledging that perfection is a journey, not a destination.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites on your Windows machine:

- **C Compiler:** Neovim on Windows requires a C compiler like GCC. Ensure that you have a C compiler installed on your system.
- **Neovim:** Obviously.
