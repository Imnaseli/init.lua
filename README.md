> my neovim configuration

It reflects my experience and understanding of how Neovim can be tailored to enhance productivity and provide an enjoyable coding environment. I've spent considerable time fine-tuning this configuration, and I continue to use it for my own coding tasks. I use neovim currently on my windows machine for university, although the configuration is far from perfect, as i only install plugins when i really need them.
